# TerminalStartup
A small script I made to help me differenciate which Ubuntu distro I just booted up, and/or which window has which distro, etc, etc.

I made the script because I have a few different Ubuntu distros installed on my Windows box, and sometimes I would get confused which distro I am working in, and/or which distro I just booted up.

This script will display a bar at the top of the console and by default, the script will print out the distro's name and version number.


#SYNTAX:
startbar [-b "BGCOLOR"]/[-f "FGCOLOR"]/[-t "TITLE"]
